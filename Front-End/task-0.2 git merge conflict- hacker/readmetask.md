<h2>About Me.</h2>


Hey! I'm Kumaran, undergrad at NITT.

So my native is Chennai and i was brought up partly in Chennai, Salem and also Trichy before actually joining NITT.I'm really a quiet and shy type of person but certainly not an introvert. I take a lot of time to get comfortable and be myself around new people and I'm fun to hangout with too

About my interests, I do love football and I'm a huge fan of **FCB**(writing this during levante-barca game :sob:).  And a **F.R.I.E.N.D.S** fan too but I dont binge-watch any series though. Oh btw I love Photography too and I'm a part of **Pixelbug.**

**Front-end stuff** 

I was hooked into web development when I visited a game-like portfolio website and was fascinated and wanted build something like that. So I started learning web dev related stuff and here I am.  I do like coding in codepen.io and you can see my pens [here](https://codepen.io/Kums/).
